# Using Azure Policy with Network Groups (Preview)

In this article, you'll learn how to use Azure Policy to power your Network Groups dynamciall at high scale using extensive conditional expressions. You create these conditional statements using the basic editor by selecting parameters and operators from a drop-down menu. You'll also learn how to use the advanced editor to update conditional statements of an existing network group.

## What is Azure Policy
Azure Policy is a service to enable you to enforce per-resource governance at scale. It can be used to specify conditional expressions which define group membership, as opposed to explicit lists of virtual networks. This condition will continue to power your network groups dynamically, allowing virtual networks to join and leave the group automatically as their fullfilment of the condition changes, with no Network Manager operation required.

Read more about the full capabilities of [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview)

## <a name="parameters"></a> Parameters and operators

Virtual networks with dynamic memberships are selected using conditional statements. You can define more than one conditional statement by using *logical operators* such as **AND** and **OR** for scenarios where you need to further narrow the selected virtual networks. 


## Basic editor

Assume you have the following virtual networks in your subscription. Each virtual network has either a *Production* or *Test* tag associated. You only want to select virtual networks with the Production tag and contain **VNet-A** in the name.

* VNet-A-EastUS - *Production*
* VNet-A-WestUS - *Production*
* VNet-B-WestUS - *Test*
* VNet-C-WestUS - *Test*
* VNetA - *Production*
* VNetB - *Test*

To begin using the basic editor to create your conditional statement, you need to create a new network group.

1. Go to your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance and select **Network Groups** under *Settings*. Then select **+ Add** to create a new network group.

1. Enter a **Name** for the network group. Then select the **Conditional statements** tab.

1. Select **Tags** from the drop-down under *Parameter* and then select **Exist** from the drop-down under *Operator*.

1. Enter **Prod** under *Condition*, then select **Evaluate**. You should only see VNet-A-EastUS, VNet-B-WestUS, and VNetA show up in the list.

1. Add another conditional statement by selecting the logical operator **AND**. Select **Name** for the *Parameter* and **Contains** for the *Operator*. Enter **VNet-A** into the *Condition* field. Select **Evaluate** to see which virtual network shows up in the list. You should only see VNet-A-EastUS and VNet-A-WestUS.

1. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create** once validation has passed.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **basic editor** is only available during the creation of a network group. 

## Advanced editor

The basic editor provides a subset of functionaliy to give an easy user experience. Expereienced users can use the advanced editor or create their policy resources directly to take advantage of the full feature set Azure Policy has to offer. Visit (Policy documentation)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#policy-rule] to see the full set of functionality.

1. Select the network group created in the previous section. Then select the **Conditional statements** tab.

1. You'll see the conditional statements for the network group in the advance editor view as followed:

    ```json
    {
       "allOf": [
          {
             "field": "tags['Environment']",
             "exists": true
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "VNet-A"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

    The `"allOf"` parameter contains both the conditional statements that are separated by the **AND** logical operator.

1. To add another conditional statement for a *Name* field *not containing* **WestUS**, enter the following into the advanced editor:

    ```json
    {
       "allOf": [
          {
             "field": "tags['Environment']",
             "exists": true
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "VNet-A"
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "notcontains": "WestUS"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

1. Then select **Evaluate**. You should only see VNet-A-EastUS virtual network in the list.

1. Select **Review + save** and then select **Save** once validation has passed.

See [Parameter and operators](#parameters) for the complete list of parameters and operators you can use with the advanced editor. See below for more examples:

## More examples

### Example 1: OR operator only

This example uses the **OR** logical operator to separate two conditional statements.

* Basic editor:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-exclude-elements/or-operator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of network group conditional statement using the OR logical operator.":::

* Advanced operator:

    ```json
    {
       "anyOf": [
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "VNet-A"
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "VNetA"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

The `"anyOf"` parameter contains both the conditional statements that are separated by the **OR** logical operator.

### Example 2: AND and OR operator at the same time

* Basic editor:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-exclude-elements/both-operator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of network group conditional statement using both OR and AND logical operator.":::

* Advanced editor:

```json
{
   "allOf": [
      {
         "anyOf": [
            {
               "field": "Name",
               "contains": "VNet-A"
            },
            {
               "field": "Name",
               "contains": "VNetA"
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "field": "Name",
         "notcontains": "West"
      }
   ]
}
```

Both `"allOf"` and `"anyOf"` are used in the code. Since the **AND** operator is last in the list, it is on the outer part of the code containing the two conditional statements with the **OR** operator.

> Conditionals should filter on resource type Microsoft.Network/virtualNetwork to improve efficiency
> This condition is prepended for you on any conditionals specified through the portal.
